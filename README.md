# PropulsorSystemsDesign
This code is intended to estimate initial size, and performance requirements for Propulsor Zero
- The program is run from Stages.py
- The Fans.py program is identical to PropulsorSpec (see https://github.com/jonnyhyman/PropulsorSpec for more on that)
- Each Python script defines the input requirements for that subsystem. Parameters are changed in-line, although it would be easy to change that.
